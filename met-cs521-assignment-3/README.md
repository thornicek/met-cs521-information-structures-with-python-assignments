# CS521 Lab 3 Tomas Hornicek

The python file for lab 3 can be found in the file: "cipher.py". This project uses python to encode and decode messages using different ciphers. The message that was encoded and decoded can be found in the text file:  "message.txt". The ciphers I used for this lab were Caesar's cipher, Vignere cipher and One-time pad cipher.
