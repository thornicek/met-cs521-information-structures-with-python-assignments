# CS521 Lab 2 Tomas Hornicek

My lab 2 contains a non-coding part, for which questions and answers can be found in the file: "tHornicek_Written_CS501_HW2.pdf", and a coding part, for which answers can be found in the python file: "hw2.py".

For the coding part I have defined functions that do the following:
- Determines whether a year is a leap year
- Determines whether a number is a triangular number
- Determines the triangular sum, given lower and upper bound
- Generates a list of n random numbers(1-9)
- Determine sum of two binary numbers, answer in decimal
- Determine the sum of given numbers
