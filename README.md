# Met CS 521 Information Structures with Python Assignments

This repository contains all my assignments I did for my Information Structures with Python class. This course covers the concepts of the object-oriented approach to software design and development using Python. It includes a detailed discussion of programming concepts starting with the fundamentals of data types, control structures methods, classes, arrays and strings, and proceeding to advanced topics such as inheritance and polymorphism, creating user interfaces, exceptions and streams.
