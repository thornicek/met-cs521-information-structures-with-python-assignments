# CS521 Lab 4 Tomas Hornicek

My lab 4 contains a non-coding part and a coding part. The  The non-coding part can be found in the file hw4.pdf. The coding part is divided into 4 parts: Problem 4, Problem 5, Problem 6 and Problem 7.

# Coding Problem 4

For problem 4, I have created a Doubly Linked List from scratch. The assignment contains two classes; Node class and DoublyLinkedList class.

# Coding Problem 5 

For problem 5, I have coded a function merge_sort. This function sorts a given list using merge sort algorithm. The function takes a list as input and returns a sorted version of the list.

# Coding Problem 6

For problem 6, I wrote a function, lst_to_dict, that has three parameters; a list of unsorted numbers with no duplicates, a start number, and an end number. This function returns a dictionary with all integers between the start and end number (inclusive) as the keys and their respective indices in the list as the value. If the integer is not in the list, the corresponding value would be None.

# Coding Problem 7

For problem 7, I wrote a function, target_sum, which takes a list and a target number as arguments and returns the indices of two numbers that add up to the target number.
